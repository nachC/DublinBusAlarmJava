# Dublin Bus Alarm


#  RTPI API is deprecated. Refactoring code to make use of the new GTFS-R API: https://developer.nationaltransport.ie/api-details#api=gtfsr

Dublin Bus Alarm is a native android app being developed using Java, where the user can choose a Bus stop (from the Dublin Bus Service) using Google Maps and an alarm will let the user know when the stop was reached.

1st -> type the bus line and tap search

2nd -> select the route direction (inbound/outbound)

3rd -> select the stop where you want the alarm to be set off, by selecting a marker in the Google Maps activity

4th -> when the distance between your location and the stop's location is less than 50 meters, the alarm will be set off.
